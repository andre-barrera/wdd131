        <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know 
            that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the 
            thing which he commandeth them.</p>

        <h2>2 Nephy 2:27</h2>
        <p>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to 
           choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity 
           and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>
